# DECISIONS

> Living log of architectural and design decisions for `codebase-rag-mcp`.
> Each entry captures the **context**, the **decision**, and the
> **consequences** — including what we are deliberately *not* doing and
> what would cause us to revisit. Keep entries short and dated.

## D-001 · Adopt a src-layout with hatchling

- **Date:** 2026-08-20
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Need an installable Python package that is also friendly
  to editors, CI, and packaging tools.
- **Decision:** Use a `src/codebase_rag_mcp/` layout built with
  `hatchling`. Tests run with `pytest` against `pythonpath = ["src"]`.
- **Consequences:**
  - Forces tests and CLI to import the installed package, catching
    packaging mistakes (missing `__init__.py`, wrong names) early.
  - `hatchling` has no extra config beyond the wheel target.
  - Revise if we need to ship native extensions or data files.

## D-002 · Pin Python ≥ 3.11

- **Date:** 2026-08-20
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Modern type-parameter syntax (`type X = ...`), `StrEnum`,
  and the official MCP SDK are most stable on 3.11+.
- **Decision:** `requires-python = ">=3.11"`.
- **Consequences:**
  - We can use `Self`, `LiteralString`, task-group cancellation, and
    PEP 695 generics without backports.
  - Drops Python 3.9 / 3.10 from the matrix.

## D-003 · FAISS-CPU, not FAISS-GPU

- **Date:** 2026-08-20
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** RAG indexing of a typical codebase (10k–100k chunks) fits
  comfortably in CPU memory; GPU FAISS would add a heavy native dep.
- **Decision:** Depend on `faiss-cpu`.
- **Consequences:**
  - No CUDA toolchain required to install or run.
  - Trade-off: slower index build for very large corpora. Revisit if
    we start indexing millions of chunks.

## D-004 · Hybrid retrieval (dense + BM25)

- **Date:** 2026-08-20
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Code search benefits from exact identifier matching
  (BM25) *and* semantic similarity (embeddings). Either alone is weak.
- **Decision:** Index with both `faiss-cpu` (dense) and `rank-bm25`
  (sparse) and combine scores in the retrieval layer.
- **Consequences:**
  - Two indexes to keep in sync; persisted together in `INDEX_DIR`.
  - Need a merge strategy (RRF, weighted sum, ...). To be decided
    when implementing `retrieval/`.

## D-005 · Pluggable LLM providers via httpx

- **Date:** 2026-08-20
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Users have keys with NVIDIA, Groq, OpenRouter, Gemini,
  or run a local OpenAI-compatible server.
- **Decision:** Expose one adapter per provider under
  `generation/providers/`, all speaking the OpenAI Chat Completions
  shape over `httpx`. Provider selection is config-driven, never
  hard-coded.
- **Consequences:**
  - Adapters stay small and uniform; easier to test in isolation.
  - Anything that doesn't speak OpenAI Chat needs a translator.

## D-006 · MCP transport: stdio only for now

- **Date:** 2026-08-20
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** MCP clients (Claude Desktop, editors, CLIs) primarily
  launch servers as child processes.
- **Decision:** Ship the stdio transport via the official
  `mcp.server.stdio.stdio_server` helper.
- **Consequences:**
  - Zero networking setup for local use.
  - SSE / HTTP transports can be added later without changing tool
    definitions — only the run loop changes.

## D-007 · Scaffold-first; no RAG logic yet

- **Date:** 2026-08-20
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Want a clean, lint-clean, type-checked, tested baseline
  before any pipeline code lands, so later commits are easy to review.
- **Decision:** Submodules are placeholder `__init__.py` files with
  docstrings describing intent. Only `config`, `cli`, and the MCP
  server stub are implemented.
- **Consequences:**
  - Easy to onboard new contributors; no half-finished logic to read.
  - The MCP server only exposes a `ping` tool today. Real tools
    (`search`, `impact`, `ask`) appear in later PRs.

## D-008 · Tooling: ruff + mypy + pytest in CI

- **Date:** 2026-08-20
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Want a single, fast, conventional toolchain.
- **Decision:**
  - **ruff** for lint and format (`ruff check`, `ruff format --check`).
  - **mypy** for static types (lenient at the package boundary while
    third-party type stubs mature; tightened per-module as we go).
  - **pytest** for tests.
  - GitHub Actions runs all four on every push.
- **Consequences:**
  - One source of truth for style and types; PRs only need to pass CI.
  - We can add `pre-commit` later if we want local enforcement.
